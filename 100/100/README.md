Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system that manages containerized applications in a clustered environment. It is designed to manage distributed applications and services across varied infrastructure.

In this guide, weâ€™ll discuss basic Kubernetes concepts. We will talk about its system architecture, the problems it solves, and the model that it uses to handle containerized deployments and scaling.

After reading this guide, you should be familiar with core Kubernetes concepts like the kube-apiserver, Nodes, Pods, Services, Deployments, and Volumes.
