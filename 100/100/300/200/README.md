# 200 - kube-apiserver

One of the most important master services is an API server. This is the main management point of the entire cluster as it allows a user to configure Kubernetesâ€™ workloads and organizational units. It is also responsible for making sure that the ```etcd``` store and the service details of deployed containers are in agreement. It acts as the bridge between various components to maintain cluster health and disseminate information and commands.

The API server implements a RESTful interface, which means that many different tools and libraries can readily communicate with it. A client called ***kubectl*** is available as a default method of interacting with the Kubernetes cluster from a local computer.
