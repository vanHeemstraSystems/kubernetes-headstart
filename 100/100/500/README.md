# 500 - Kubernetes Objects and Workloads

While containers are the underlying mechanism used to deploy applications, Kubernetes uses additional layers of abstraction over the container interface to provide scaling, resiliency, and life cycle management features. Instead of managing containers directly, users define and interact with instances composed of various primitives provided by the Kubernetes object model. We will go over the different types of objects that can be used to define these workloads below.
